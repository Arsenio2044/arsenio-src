> Arsenio is a total conversion mod for Half-Life 2: Episode Two that takes place in the far dark future.
# Features

- Multiple different factions of enemies and allies.
- Parkour system (Credit to Mobility mod)
- Too many weapons (trust me)
- Completely redesigned combat system.
- Runs in IVEngine 2 (No not VScript. IVEngine 2 is an overhaul of the source engine)
- Many more features are unannounced or still in development.

More will be documented on the wiki.
