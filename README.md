> Arsenio 2044 takes place in a world decimated by 4 decades of warfare, corruption, instability, and loss. The Black Mesa incident caused portal storms across the world which teleported millions of creatures from other worlds. Militaries were overwhelmed and the 2000’s consisted of economic collapse, mass casualties due to aliens and warfare. Megacorporations took control of whatever was left of nations. In the 2010’s the world grew a little more stable, the internet and AIs grew, and corporations like Usova and Glitch-Corp grew even bigger. You play as Arsenio, a man who is escaping an unknown situation (vague). The game starts with Arsenio on a train to Midinus, one of the last megacities in the US (Now known as the RUSA). Midinus is known for it's high crime rates but also has unique sci fi architecture mixed with older looking architecture("old" in this sense means anything before the 2020s). During the games story, arsenio encounters many different enemies and characters.
